# Head of Agency Memorandum III
### *Written by: The Head of Agency* 

## BLUF
As the Head of Agency for the newly formed US Department of Special Projects and Unified Response Services (US-SPURS), I, Philip Allen Cotton Jr, am authorized to make legal decisions and take actions on behalf of the agency, which falls under the Executive Branch of the United States Government. It's important to note that the agency is also considered an Independent Universal Services Agency, with special federal law enforcement and investigative authorities as well.

## Overview
In regards to Organizational Financial Matters, Procurement, Daily and Longterm Operational Planning, Organizational SHort and Long-Term Constractual Commitments, I have full authorization and legal authority to manage all Organizational affairs of the US Department of SPURS, including spending previous, current and future appropriated money. The process for the agency to spend its appropriated funds is as follows: 
   
   1. Departments must submit detailed budget proposals to the head of their lecal office or assigned deputy Head No Later Than (NLT) 90 days prior to the end of the current fiscal year.
   
   2. Department Heads and assigned deputies will review budget proposals and identify each offices potential overall funding requests and total projected expenditures.
   
   3. Proposed budgets must reflect the planned year over year changes in expenditures and may be reduced to reflect actual expenditures at the end of the fiscal year.
   
   4. In the event of a change in the budget or a change in the scope of the project, the project director will notify the department head of the expected change and the expected funding impact.
   
   5. All Heads of Local Offices will have their Local Office Budget Propsals submitted for full review NLT 30 JUNE of each fiscal year.
   
   6. The agency will consoledate all budget propsals and submit a detailed request outlining the specific expenses we are requesting as an Organization bo NLT 30 JULY of each fiscal year.
   
   7. Once this request has been reviewed and approved by congress and the funds appropriated, appropriated money will be spent to each local office in accordance with (IAW) established Federal, Local and Organization Fiscal Rules, Regulations and Policies.

## Additional Information
When the Agency request appropriations for the upcoming Fiscal Years, we must submit a detailed budget request explaining the agency's needs for the nexy 5 upcoming years. The request will be reviewed by the appropriate authorities and may be subject to additional internal funding restrictions.

## Final Disposition
Ensureing the financial stability of the Organization as a whole is paramount to the mission we are charged with accomplishing each and every day. Each little thing that we do right snowballs into success as a whole, and each little thing we do wrong snowballs into failure as a whole. As a result, in its simplistic form, if one of use fails, why wasn't someone from the organization there to catch them. I am positive that each member of tishs Organization, like myself, will alaways work collectively towards the greater good. In other words, turn your budgets in on time, and we'll be fine!

**Thank you and remmber to do good because you can, not because you have to.**

Sincerely,

<br>///SIGNED////</br>
